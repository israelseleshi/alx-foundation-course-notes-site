## 🌡️ What Is Climate Change?  
### A Fundamental Shift in Earth’s Systems

Climate change refers to **long-term alterations** in temperature, weather patterns, and ecosystem dynamics.  

#### 📜 Historical Perspective:
- Natural causes: Solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, etc.

#### 🏭 Modern Acceleration:
- Since the **Industrial Revolution**, human activities—especially **fossil fuel combustion**—have been the primary driver.
- This has **exponentially increased atmospheric greenhouse gases**, altering global climate systems.

## 🧪 The Science: Greenhouse Effect Simplified

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, functioning like a **thermal blanket**. Human activity has intensified this natural process.

### 🔍 Major Greenhouse Gases & Their Sources

| Greenhouse Gas | Description | Main Human Sources |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **CO₂**         | Most prevalent GHG | 🚗 Transportation, 💡 Energy generation, 🌳 Deforestation |
| **CH₄**         | 80x more potent short-term than CO₂ | 🚜 Agriculture, ⚙️ Oil & gas industry |
